Taking a flying wing configuration model as the initial shape of flying wing configuration aircraft,
the location and the deflection angle of \n belly flaps in the take off
and landing process are studied by the method of numerical simulation,
and the influence law of belly flap deflection on elevator rudder effect and ground effect is obtained.
The results show that when the belly flap is located at 40 percent
mean aerodynamic chord behind the center of gravity,
a high lift enhancement efficiency can be maintained at high angles of attack,
and there is a small change in the pitching moment.
As the deflection angle of the belly flap increases,
the lift and the drag show a quasi linear growth,
while the change of the pitching moment is small
and can be trimmed by about 1 \0 degree deflection of the elevator.
When the belly flap is deflected,
the rudder efficiency of the elevator decreases by about 6 percent,
and the increment of lift caused by ground effect increases,
while the longitudinal static stability is decreased.
Flying wing configuration aircraft is advantageous
on the characteristics of stealth and aerodynamics,
but due to lack of conventional elevator and rudder,
gust alleviation control method for the aircraft
with conventional configuration is not suitable anymore.
For the flying wing configuration \\ aircraft with large aspect ratio,
a wind tunnel model, support system with two degrees of freedom of plunging and pitching,
and gust generator which is capable of generating continuous sine gust are designed.
Three control schemes that can simultaneously reduce wing tip acceleration and wing root bending
moment are designed using classical control law theory. Wind tunnel test of gust alleviation active
control is conducted and the open and closed loop test data are analyzed.
Test data show that the wing tip acceleration and the wing root bending moment
due to gust of flying wing aircraft have a large peak at the frequency of pitch mode,
while the peak at the frequency of first bending mode is relatively small, for different
combinations of control surface,
the effects of gust alleviation are different, for flying wing configuration aircraft,
selecting the appropriate combination of control surfaces
can effectively reduce the gust load and gust response.
